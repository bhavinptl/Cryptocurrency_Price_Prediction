# Cryptocurrency Price Prediction with Twitter Sentiment Analysis

## Description

This project aims to predict the prices of cryptocurrencies, specifically Bitcoin (BTC-USD), using historical price data and Twitter sentiment analysis. It utilizes deep learning techniques, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, to make future price predictions based on past price patterns and Twitter sentiment related to the cryptocurrency market.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:


2. Install the required Python packages using `pip`:


## Usage

1. Ensure you have the required Python packages installed as mentioned in the installation section.

2. Run the Jupyter notebook `cryptocurrency_price_prediction.ipynb` to perform the following steps:

- Download historical Bitcoin price data from Yahoo Finance.
- Perform data preprocessing and feature engineering, including removing unnecessary columns, handling missing values, and scaling the data.
- Build an LSTM-based deep learning model to predict future cryptocurrency prices.
- Train the model on the historical data.
- Visualize the actual and predicted prices using Matplotlib.

3. The notebook contains detailed comments and explanations to guide you through each step of the process.
